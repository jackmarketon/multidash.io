# Multidash.js

Multidash is a fully NPM friendly tool for running multiple outputing commands at the same time.

For example, you formerly needed two terminal windows open to run:

* `npm run watch` (lets say this is for webpack-dev-server)
* `npm run test` (lets say this is for karma tests)

Now you can view those both in the same terminal window screen, and start them from at the same time.

This should encouraging similar environments across developers. And prevent developers on your team from forgetting to run tests along side your dev.
